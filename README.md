Hi, and welcome to my Dashboard!

There's a few concepts that will be built here, and it's all things I check on a daily basis, so I figured hey, why not just make a page that contains them all... great!

1. Weather tracker - I want this by default to track London, UK, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

2. Date/Time - same as above, I want this the same locations.

3. Amazon search -
   I want this to be a search that is saved as a list that contains a hyperlink, so, for example, you search "monitor" and it'll save a hyperlink to amazon.co.uk with
   the search input of "monitor". That is then saved on the dashboard as a list item so it can be used again.

4. Flight tracking -
   tracking flight prices for certain locations.
